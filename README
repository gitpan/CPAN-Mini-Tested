SYNOPSYS
      use CPAN::Mini::Tested;

      CPAN::Mini::Tested->update_mirror(
       remote => "http://cpan.mirrors.comintern.su",
       local  => "/usr/share/mirrors/cpan",
       trace  => 1

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a subclass of CPAN::Mini which checks the CPAN Testers
    database for passing tests of that distribution on your platform.
    Distributions will only be downloaded if there are passing tests.

    The major differences are that it will download the testers.db file from
    the CPAN Testers web site when updating indices, and it will check if a
    distribution has passed tests in the specified platform before applying
    other filtering rules to it.

    See the module documentation for more information.
