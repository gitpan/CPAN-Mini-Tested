NAME
    CPAN::Mini::Tested - create a CPAN mirror using modules that have passed
    tests

SYNOPSYS
      use CPAN::Mini::Tested;

      CPAN::Mini::Tested->update_mirror(
       remote => "http://cpan.mirrors.comintern.su",
       local  => "/usr/share/mirrors/cpan",
       trace  => 1
      );

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a subclass of CPAN::Mini which checks the CPAN Testers
    database for passing tests of that distribution on your platform.
    Distributions will only be downloaded if there are passing tests.

    The major differences are that it will download the testers.db file from
    the CPAN Testers web site when updating indices.

CAVEATS
    This is a prototype module, which will need further work before using in
    a production environment.

    This module is only of use if there are active testers for your
    platform.

    Note that the lack of passing tests in the testers database does not
    mean that a module will not run on your platform, only that it will not
    be downloded. Likewise, passing tests do not mean that a module will run
    on your platform.
